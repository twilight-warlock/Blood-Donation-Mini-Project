            <p>We are a non-profitable organization which aims to provide a better and easier way to find the required blood needed
            at the time. </p>
            <p>Voluntary Non-Remunerated Blood Donation (VNRBD) is the cornerstone of a safe and sufficient blood supply. GBF works with blood collectors in low and middle-income countries to establish and enhance the recruitment, retention and management of volunteer donors.
                <p>

                    A system of voluntary donation driven by benevolence is preferable. However, creating a community appreciation of blood donation is challenging; as is recruiting, motivating and retaining donors and managing them effectively.</p>

        <p>
            Every day in the world’s poorest countries, people die because of a shortage of blood. GBF helps blood collectors in these countries by providing money, equipment, training and other forms of support – including launching voluntary blood donation programs.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since Africa collects most of its blood from high-school students, GBF saw a need to retain these young donors after they graduate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pledge 25 Club was developed to keep donors engaged after they leave school. Working with the Africa Society for Blood Transfusion, GBF is providing tools and resources to help expand this initiative across Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
            By creating a local, national, and international blood donor family, Pledge 25 Club members serve their community by pledging to donate 25 units of blood by the age of 30. Members also commit to leading a healthy, low-risk lifestyle to protect the patients receiving their life-saving blood.
